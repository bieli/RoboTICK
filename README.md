# RoboTICK - OpenSource &amp; OpenHardware robotic free mobile platform (based on ROS)


## Introduction 
Few months ago I decided to build my own mobile robotic platform from scratch. I have a few motivators: understanding prototyping robots, building vehicle from CAD design to ready to use and learning new version of ROS. Of course future plans are: deploying Machine Learning models on platform, autonomous alghoritms, high availability on hardware and software levels by redundancy internal systems (power, computer, network, etc).

## Official idea presentation
Presentation from my [IoT, Hardware & Robotics meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/Internet-of-Things-Hardware-Robotics-Pozna%C5%84/) about this project [Let's build a robot with ROS - Internet of Things, Hardware & Robotics meetup #1 Pozna≈Ñ](https://www.slideshare.net/bieli/lets-build-a-robot-with-ros-internet-of-things-hardware-robotics-meetup-1-pozna)
