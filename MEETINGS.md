Project meetings
=====

1. Warm-up and current hardware review
----
Decisions:
- 1/2 size prototype (better scaling and comfortable for first line experiments)
- add foloders in repository about mechanics with components size
- DIY how to build body (maybe images with comments)

Updates:
- we need hardware skeleton for robotic platform, before creating body


2. Few new things
----
Decisions:
- new location of wheels in the middle of robot body, two motors one per wheel
- case construction from thin metal - no need welding anymore
- we need law information about presentation machine for robot (normalization low different by country; in Poland we need special signed area with phisical operator inside)

Updates:
- new inventor attached to project - we welcome Bartek
