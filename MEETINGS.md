Project meetings
=====

1. Warm-up and current hardware review
----
Decisions:
- 1/2 size prototype (better scaling and comfortable for first line experiments)
- add foloders in repository about mechanics with components size
- DIY how to build body (maybe images with comments)

Updates:
- we need hardware skeleton for robotic platform, before creating body
