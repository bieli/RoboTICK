Project meetings
=====

1. Warm-up and current hardware review
----
Decisions:
- 1/2 size prototype (better scaling and comfortable for first line experiments)
- add foloders in repository about mechanics with components size
- DIY how to build body (maybe images with comments)

Updates:
- we need hardware skeleton for robotic platform, before creating body


2. Few new things
----
Decisions:
- new location of wheels in the middle of robot body, two motors one per wheel
- case construction from thin metal - no need welding anymore
- we need law information about presentation machine for robot (normalization low different by country; in Poland we need special signed area with phisical operator inside)

Updates:
- new inventor attached to project - we welcome Bartek


3. New experience for RoboTICK in 1:1 scale (not official)
----
Posibilites:
- FreeCAD is not optimal software for building advanced constructions (i.e. building frame for RoboTICK micro - from frame 2_1 base - it's about 14h with learning soft.)
- Bartek frame construction proposals: we need the same construction as oldest cars for frame, two strong metal rails in the central of frame construction and we need aditionals witch connected with rails
- We building frame for RoboTICK micro from frame 2_1 base based on PLA platics from 3D printer and ALUminum rods (results: optimal construction stiffness, simple connectors with bolts and nuts)
- we need discussion about new RoboTICK micro frame for building next in 1:2 scale prototype


4. Reverting from fantasy to basics use cases for 1:1 scale vehicle
----
- we need bussines cases and share document with team
- we need spreadsheet with general vehicle phisical assumptions for starting discussion from scratch
- we have a "garage" where we can realize this project by regular team meetings
